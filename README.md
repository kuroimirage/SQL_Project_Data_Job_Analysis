# Introduction
"ðŸ“Š Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores ðŸ’° top-paying jobs, ðŸ”¥ in-demand skills, and ðŸ“ˆ where high demand meets high salary in data analytics."

From a personal perspective, this project was made with the intention of practicing and improving my SQL skills - The main goal was to learn, with a secondary goal to find out what skills I should be focusing on when jumping into the data analyst job market.

> ðŸ”Ž Check out the SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)
# Background
Data and guidance on the project comes from [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), and this data was collected in 2023. All queries were created using the shell provided by Luke, modified to fit my needs. 

> ðŸ”Ž Additonal queries written while following the course: [sql_c1_queries](/sql_c1%20_queries/)

### Questions answered through these SQL queries:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst roles?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
The following tools were used to create this project:

- **SQL:** Language used to query the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** DBMS chosen for the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Software used for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and sharing the SQL scripts and analysis.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project investigated specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how each question was answered:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, data analyst positions were filtered by average yearly salary and location, focusing on jobs available to someone living in Michigan such as myself (meaning remote or local positions). The 15 highest paying opportunities for this field were found.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name,
    job_posted_date::DATE
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    (job_location = 'Anywhere' OR job_location LIKE '%MI%') AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

Here is a breakdown of the top data analyst roles found from this query:

- **High End Salary Range:** Top 15 paying data analyst roles spanned from $650,000 to $169,000.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like Meta, AT&T, and Mayo Clinic were among these results, showing interest for this type of role across multiple industries.
- **Remote over Local:** Jobs listed as remote took up 13 of the 15 roles found, with the remaining two being in Michigan. This lines up with prior expectations.

### 2. Skills for the Top Paying Jobs
To see what skills were sought after at high-paying positions, all skills listed for each of the top 15 job postings were found and listed by referencing our first query as a CTE and joining the tables with job postings and skills respectively.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        (job_location = 'Anywhere' OR job_location LIKE '%MI%') AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 15
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

Here is a breakdown of the most demanded skills from these 15 job postings:
- **SQL:** The leading skill, mentioned 10 times in job postings.
- **Python:** Mentioned 9 times.
- **Tableau:** Mentioned 6 times.
- Other skills such as **Azure**, **R**, **Excel**, **Pandas**, **Snowflake**, **Go**, **Power BI** â€“ Each appears with varying degrees of demand.

### 3. Top Demanded Skills
Next, to see what skills were in demand across all job listings meeting the criteria of being based in Michigan or remote, an aggregate count of the top 5 most demanded skills were collected.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    (job_work_from_home = true OR job_location LIKE '%MI%')
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Here is a breakdown of the 5 most demanded skills across all job postings:
- **SQL and Excel** were the two most demanded skills due to their usefulness is data processing and manipulation.
- **Python** was the next most demanded skill, showing a desire for technical skills.
- **Tableau and Power BI** followed shortly behind, thanks to the importance of data storytelling and visualization.

*Table of the demand for the top 5 skills in data analyst job postings*

### 4. Top Paying Skills
Finding how average salaries correlated with the demanding skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND (job_work_from_home = true OR job_location LIKE '%MI%')
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
